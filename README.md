# Msci_Dissertation
A collection of code and data to demonstrate what I have learnt and how I have acquired my data.

These scripts were not intended for personal use, they simply demonstrate some of what I have done as
part of my course. My ability to use Matlab is quite crude, I got on much better with Bash and R. however
I have done a poor job of commenting which I will improve in future. This has been my first attempt at
writing code. 

Sort_v4.0.sh --> This sorts the cross correlations of my own data into folders. 
It is the only instance of Bash I have commented to a sensible degree.

Constant_Linear_Quad_Josh_v1.0.matlab -> This was how I ran the linear 
and dual regression analysis comparing the timecourses of my components. It's a brute force script, 
so all I do is repeat the same line each time. I struggled with 
MatLab and it was faster for me to do it this way. I prefer R.

Constant_Linear_Quadratic_Correlations_Heatmap_Plotter_v4.0.R --> This is how I plotted the 
linear and quadratic regression outputs.

Plot_Component_vs_Component_Connectivity_V2.0.R --> This is how I plotted my heatmaps comparing the
"Relationship of Component Activity over Time"

merge_and_melodic_improved_local_mac_GSRemoved_v5.0.sh --> This is how I merged my files and then performed
a melodic ICA on them.

BRCOPT_dual_regression_att10_My_Mac_GSRemoved_v3.0.sh --> This was used to perform a regression on my data.

cc_for_nifti_v3.0.sh --> This is an example of the code used to check the
spatial correlations of my own components.

cc_for_nifti_yeo_comp_v2.0.sh  --> This is an example of how I calculated the spatial 
correlations between my data and Yeo et al's 2011 cortical networks.
